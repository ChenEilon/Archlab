t = 640ns:
The control is in state FETCH0. The DMA is in state READ.
sram_ADDR is set to pc since the control's transaction is prioritized.
The DMA will remain in state READ until the control's transaction is done.

t = 660ns:
Now that the control is in state DEC0, it's safe for the DMA to initiate a read transaction.
sram_ADDR is set to dma_src.

t = 670ns:
The DMA is in state EXTRACT.

t = 680ns:
The DMA is in state WRITE and dma_reg is set to sram_DO.
The control is in state EXEC0 and the opcode is LD, so the DMA will remain in state WRITE until the control's transactions are done.

t = 720ns:
Now that the control is again in state DEC0, it's safe for the DMA to initiate a write transaction.
sram_ADDR is set to dma_dst.
sram_WE is set.
sram_DI is set to dma_reg.

t = 730ns, 740ns, 750ns:
These cycles are hazard free, so we can see a full cycle of the DMA state machine.
